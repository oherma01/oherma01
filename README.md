#### 👋 About Me 

Hello, I’m Oliver, a career amateur with a background in automation, systems administration and cloud computing. 

#### ☁️ What I'm Doing 

I'm interested in applying research computing towards the goal of addressing global issues in the technology sphere.

#### ⚙️ Core Competencies (as I would define them) 

- **Source control:** proficiency with losing and unlosing with Git

- **Continuous integration:** dumb pipes, lazy people

- **Infrastructure as code:** less clicking, more sipping

- **Configuration Management:** turning it off and on again

- **Containerization:** there's a microservice for that

- **Monitoring and logging:** what goes up, must come down

- **Test automation:** KISS

- **Cloud computing:** someone else's datacentre 

- **Security:** all your secrets are belong to us

- **Collaboration and communication:** some things are easier said than done
